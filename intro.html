                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Himanshu, and I'm a passionate front-end developer currently
                    pursuing
                    my B.Tech degree in Computer Science from KNIT Sultanpur. With a strong foundation in C++
                    programming
                    and expertise in logical thinking and problem-solving, I bring a unique perspective to my work in
                    front-end development.

                    Throughout my journey, I have gained a deep understanding of data structures, DBMS (Database
                    Management
                    Systems), and OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming). These skills have not only equipped me to build
                    efficient and scalable applications but have also honed my ability to analyze complex problems and
                    design elegant solutions.

                    I have a keen eye for detail and a passion for creating visually appealing and intuitive user
                    interfaces. I strive to craft seamless user experiences by combining my technical skills with my
                    understanding of human-computer interaction principles. Through my work, I aim to deliver web
                    applications that not only meet the functional requirements but also engage and delight users.

                    Collaboration is at the heart of my approach. I thrive in team environments where I can contribute
                    my
                    ideas while learning from others.

                    Beyond coding, I enjoy tackling challenging problems, exploring new technologies, and staying
                    abreast of
                    industry advancements. In my free time, you can find me exploring open-source projects,
                    participating in
                    coding competitions, or experimenting with personal coding projects that push the boundaries of my
                    knowledge.

                    I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate on innovative projects and contribute my skills to
                    create exceptional web experiences. Feel free to explore my portfolio, which showcases my projects
                    and
                    demonstrates my dedication to excellence in front-end development.

                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!
